    "Z przetestowanych metryk najlepiej poradziła sobie metryka Levenshteina, starająć się chociaż utworzyć klastry opisujące skargi na różne produkty. Niestety dużą część w tym zbiorze zajmuje klasa *Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports.* co powoduje duże zaburzenia i skargi tej klasy znajdują się w większośći klastrów. Można jednak zauważyć zależność pomiędzy *Debt collection* i *Mortgage*, które to często znajdują się w tym samym klastrze.\n",

    "Następnie przetestowałem metryki Jaccarda i Sorensena, która w ogóle nie poradziły sobie z tym zadaniem i dystanse obliczone według nich za mało się różniły, co spowodowało utworzenie pojedynczych klastrów.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sytuację tę zmieniło dopiero użycie wariantu Sorensen-DICE, użycie tej metryki spowodowało natomiast utworzenie 6 klastrów, z których 4 są bardzo małe, a dwa zawierają wiele klas. Tym razem jednak znowu możemy dostrzec, że *Debt collection* i *Mortgage* mają pewne podobieńśtwa, gdyż w pierwszym klastrze jest ich po 3, natomiast w drugim 11 i 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Po dodaniu wypisywania otagowanych treści skarg można dostrzec, że w pojedynczych lub posiadających mało członków klastrach znajdują się zazwyczaj bardzo krótkie skargi, co tłumaczy dlaczego ciężko było je przyłączyć do któregoś z większych klastrów, gdyż posiadały zbyt mało słów z nimi powiązanymi."
